A body hangs by the neck from a tree branch
A post with an unoccupied hanging cage
Several arrows stick out of a dead animal
An old trail of blood across path
A brush fire is slowly moving this way
Long dead remains of a soldier are pinned to a tree
Weathered stone circle off path
Coals from a recent, large campfire
Strong smell of wildflowers
Strong smell of cooking food
A quick succession of twigs snap
Strange, large tracks across path
Vultures circle overhead
An arrow is sticking from a tree
Unknown strange writing on standing stone
Sudden temperature drop
Path is blocked
Choke Point in trail
Destroyed Caravan
Natural Hazard off path, easily avoidable
